The outcome of this approach is mostly applied to the backend of applications, but a semantic domain model also benefits the UI. Unfortunately these semantics are often lost in translation when transferred to the frontend. I will show you a functional approach that allows you to actually reuse your domain types by combining CQRS/Event-Sourcing on the backend and the Elm architecture on the frontend with an overall messaging architecture."

Roman is a proud father of three year old twin girls, holds a bachelors degree in Cognitive Science and a Masters degree in Computer Science and is currently mainly interested in Domain Driven Design, Functional Programming and the inner workings of software development teams."
