The real magic however is that different event processing pipelines may be subscribed or disposed based on the current model. This enables powerful event handling while effectively solving the lifetime management of ongoing web requests, mouse-moves or web sockets that may occur in single page web applications. The talk will show how web applications using Elmish Streams can be scaled and made hierarchical, enabling reactive components to be reused as sub-components without the need for code changes."""
